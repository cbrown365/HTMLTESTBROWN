    <h1><em>TOON - WHAT IS IT?</em></h1>
  </div>
</div>
	<p><i>TOON</i> is a tabletop roleplaying game - to elaborate, that means it's the kind of game played with paper, pencils, and dice - requiring creative problem solving, cooperative group work, and communication above all else! You must tell the other players what you (as your character) intend to do, and they must respond using their characters and vice-versa.</p>
    <p>The Game Master (who in this game is called The Animator) is the person in control of the rules and the game in general - they throw situations at the players that the players respond to, control enemies and NPC's or Non-Player Characters that the PC's or Player Characters interact with, and bear the brunt of the players shenanigans - no game can run without one, so be nice to them for goodness sake! The more in-character a player responds to all of that and then some - the closer they are to winning that particular game.</p>
    <p> What sets <i>TOON</i> apart from most tabletop roleplaying games (or TTRPG) is the fact that it's entirely set in the make-believe land of cartoons - where death never sticks for more then 3 minutes, player's can make whoever or whatever they want to play as, and the rules are so simple even a child of about 10 or 12 could play. It truly is a "fun for the whole family" kind of game.</p>
