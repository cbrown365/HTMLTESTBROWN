	<p>This new, improved, and concise version of <i>TOON</i> is sold exclusively online - and most of it is in the form of free print outs! More to be added. This does not mean, however, that <i> TOON</i> is a game played exclusively online - <i>TOON</i> can be played off and on-line so long as all the players and Game Master/ Animator have the required materials.</p>
	<p>Here's one of those free print outs right now - enjoy! Simply right-click, save image, and print! It's that easy! Image may be replaced with a new and improved version soon!</p>
