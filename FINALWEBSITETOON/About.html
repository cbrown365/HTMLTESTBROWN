    <h1><em>ABOUT TOON</em></h1>
  </div>
</div>
	<p>Toon is a tabletop roleplaying game originally produced by Steve Jackson Games first published in 1984. Now considered more then a little obscure, it's taken the back seat for over 30 years of tabletop gaming, and now's the perfect time to play it again!</p>
	<p>The original summary still perfectly describes this timeless game:</p>

	<p>Be a cartoon star!</p>
	<p>Remember all those great cartoons you used to watch every Saturday morning? Now they're on again . . . and <i>you're</i> the star!</p>
	<p><i>TOON</i> lets you be a rabbit, duck, mouse, moose, wood-pecker, wombat, crocodile, caveman . . . <i>whatever you want</i>.</p>
	<p><i>TOON </i> brings you a world where crazy animals talk, fight, carouse, and <i>always</i> act silly. Been punched? Blown up? Steamrollered? Don't worry - you'll bounce back in the next scene, ready for more!</p>
    <p><i>TOON</i> is quick, simple, and fun. Ready to get silly? Get in <i>TOON</i> - and be a cartoon star!</p>
